1. import redux and react-redux
2. create a store in index.js

    import { createStore } from 'redux'

    const store = createStore(reducerFile)

3. Set up reducerFile in index.js

    import { reducerFile } from './path'

4. in the reducerFile set default state:

    (state = initialState, action)

5. set up Provider in index.js

    import { Provider } from 'react-redux'

    wrap App in provider and pass in store={store}

    <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
    </Provider>

6. in components that need access to state, use connect:

    import { connect } from 'react-redux'

    set up mapStateToProps function:

        const mapStateToProps = state => {
            return {
                stateValue1: state.stateValue1,
                etc.
            }  
        }

    at bottom of file wrap component export in connect function:

    export default connect(mapStateToProps, {})(componentName) // func currying

7. Set up actions. In new folder called 'actions' set up an action file.
    In this file create functions that describe various actions to state
    name export each action function
    import named action function into top of component that needs it
    also put the action function at the bottom of the connect export

// workflow:
// connect component to store if needed
// if event needs to update state:
//   - create action creator an an action
//   - import action creator and pass into connect
//   - build a case in the reducer file for that action
